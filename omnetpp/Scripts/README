#### Launch_Simulations ####

The goal of this script is to launch successively two versions of PFSSim simulator and stock the results in a file per version

Firstly you have to verify the path of the two versions:
PATH_PFSSIM_MASTER=
PATH_PFSSIM_STAGE=

This variables are in order to come back to the directory where is this script
They are necessary to a correct functioning  
CMD_BACK_PFSSIM_MASTER=
CMD_BACK_PFSSIM_STAGE=

In a terminal: launch_simulations -h to see the existing simulations

Give in argument the list of the simulation : launch_simulations 5 8 7 4
This example will execute the 5th simulation and then the 8th etc

To execute all without give the list: launch_simulations -a

You can change the name of the result files and the path where they will be save
PATH_TO_RESULT=
PREFIX=
The file will have this form: 
${PATH_TO_RESULT}${PREFIX}${I}-${SID}_before.txt
${PATH_TO_RESULT}${PREFIX}${I}-${SID}_after.txt

I is the ID of test.
SID is the number of the iteration.
One file per iteration per version of simulation.

Each simulation can be iterate Nth times (default N=5):
ITERATION=

Add a simulation:
A simply way to add your own test is the following

-Add an entry in the switch with an integer (the ID of the test)
-Put launchSimulation "[NAME OF YOUR SIMULATION]" "[OPTIONS FOR gen_input.sh]" "-c [NAME OF CONFIGURATION IN .INI FILES]"
-Add to the help entry the number and a quick description of your simulation
-Add at the end of the switch in "-a" option the same line as in step two in order to launch it when you want all simulation one after the other.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### getTimeValue ####

Python script to fetch the result previously generated.
It is formated to work only with a result of PFSSim.
It calculates the average of N iterations and put the result of two versions in csv file
It takes the time of execution too

In a terminal: python getTimeValue.py

The name of csv file will have this form : result_$I.csv
I is the same number as described previously

You must change this following variables if you changed PREFIX:
prefix =

Be sure that variable is the path where the results file of Launch_Simulations are stocked:
pathToResults=
